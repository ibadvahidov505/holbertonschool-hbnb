# HBnB – Technical Documentation  

## TASK 0 - High-Level Package Diagram  

---

## Overview  
This document presents a high-level package diagram of the HBnB Evolution application. It describes a three-layer architecture and illustrates how these layers communicate using the Facade design pattern.  

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a clear understanding of the system structure, its components, and how different parts interact with each other.

---

## Architecture Overview  
The HBnB application is designed using a layered architecture consisting of three main layers:  

1. Presentation Layer  
2. Business Logic Layer  
3. Persistence Layer  

Each layer has a specific responsibility and interacts with other layers in a structured and controlled manner.

---

## Layer Descriptions  

### 1. Presentation Layer  
This layer represents the interface between the user and the system. It includes API endpoints and services that handle incoming user requests.  

When a user performs an action, the request is received in this layer and passed through the Facade.

---

### 2. Business Logic Layer  
This layer contains the core logic of the application. It includes the main entities:  

- User  
- Place  
- Review  
- Amenity  

Responsibilities include applying business rules, validating data, and controlling application behavior.

---

### 3. Persistence Layer  
This layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database.  

It includes:  
- UserRepository  
- PlaceRepository  
- ReviewRepository  
- AmenityRepository  

---

## Facade Pattern  

The Facade acts as an intermediary between layers and provides a unified interface.

### Benefits:  
- Single entry point  
- Reduced complexity  
- Improved maintainability
